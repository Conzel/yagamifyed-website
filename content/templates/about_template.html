                Hey there—thanks for visiting my website! My name is Levin Sinan Güver and I am currently pursuing a
                Master
                of Law at the University of Zurich. My subject of interest is legal philosophy, where I am most
                passionate
                about the normative considerations underlying the criminal law. I am also interested in neuroethics and
                artificial intelligence. In my free time I enjoy going to the gym, reading, and playing chess.

                You can find my full CV here [hyperlinked]. If you are interested in the research I am conducting, check
                out
                the Research page. The Personal page includes a glimpse at some of my favourite books—each paired with a
                short summary. As the website develops, I will be sure to add more sections to the Personal page, such
                as
                quotes and pictures, so stay tuned for that!
            </p>
