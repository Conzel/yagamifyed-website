                My research follows along two strands. One of these strands is an upcoming field known as Experimental
                Philosophy. This field concerns itself with some of the foundational questions plaguing us humans since
                the beginning of time, yet taking a novel approach: using empirical methods native to fields such as
                cognitive psychology and neuroscience in tandem with the philosopher's armchair. In light of this, I am
                currently part of a research group led by Dr. Markus Kneer [hyperlinked] called Reading Guilty Minds,
                where we try to unravel the mysteries behind mental states such as belief, knowledge and intention, and
                draw conclusions for fields which concern themselves with these mental states—for example, the law.
            </p>

                The second strand is linked; in a way, it looks at the same issues—mental states, how they come to be
                and how they influence our actions—from a different point of view, namely that of the criminal law. I
                try to take a step back from the empirical work and focus on the philosophical and jurisprudential
                theories regarding action, the mind, and their link. I apply these findings cross-culturally, in light
                of the rich tradition of both common law and civil law jurisdictions.

                My Bachelor's Thesis concerned itself with the normative implications of modern neuroscientific findings
                for the criminal law. The full-text can be found on my ResearchGate profile here [hyperlinked].
